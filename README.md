# Secret Cipher Replication Program
Repository for IB Computer Science Project documenting the evolution of secret ciphers. Includes implementations for four different ciphers, each one showcasing an increasing level of complexity and security.

Each algorithm has been replicated and showcased through both user input and file input/output. The purpose of the program is to teach users esactly how each cipher worked, and give a better idea of how cryptography and cipher complexity have evolved over time. 

Algorithms included: Caesar Cipher, Vigenere Cipher, Polygram Cipher, RSA Encryption.
